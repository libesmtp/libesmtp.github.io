A Library for Posting Electronic Mail
=====================================

**libESMTP** is an SMTP client which manages submission of electronic mail via
a preconfigured Mail Transport Agent (MTA) such as
`Exim <https://www.exim.org/>`_ or `Postfix <http://www.postfix.org/>`_.

libESMTP offloads the developer of the need to handle the complexity of
negotiating the SMTP protocol by providing a simple API. Additionally
libESMTP transparently handles many SMTP extensions including authentication.
