API Reference
=============

This document describes the libESMTP programming interface.

This document is for version 1.0.6.

The libESMTP API is intended for use as an ESMTP client within a Mail User
Agent (MUA) or other program that wishes to submit mail to a preconfigured
Message Submission Agent (MSA).

The documentation is believed to be accurate but may not necessarily reflect
actual behaviour. To quote Douglas Adams:

  Much of it is apocryphal or, at the very least, wildly inaccurate.
  However, where it is inaccurate, it is *definitively* inaccurate.
